## Uses / Goal
The goal of the Amber Engine is to be a light weight, easy to use game engine. That anyone can pick up easily and start creating 2d games.

**But why use this? Why not any of the other many game engines like Unity, or Godot?!**
Well there is no good reason, but:
 * This engine unlike many others is made with Java, a programming languege usable nearly everywere.
 * The engine is open source. Found a bug... Fix it youself!
 * The engine is lightweight and portable.
 * No big download times
 * Its free! No payments at all!
